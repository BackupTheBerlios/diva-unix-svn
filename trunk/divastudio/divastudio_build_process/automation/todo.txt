	Document the procedure that explains the tasks for creating a new DiVAstudio base
	(this document can start from the information of the initial manual procedure https://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/divastudio/trunk/divastudio/divastudio_build_process/manual/DiVAStudio_build_notes.txt)
	It must also explain how to manually post the resulting file on the web (using forge ssh/scp)
	(http://divastudio.gforge.inria.fr/bundle/latest_build/DiVAStudioBase.zip)
5.2.101 Sources organization for automated build [All partners]
	All sources from all partners must be organized in the SVN following a build structure in order to simplify the compilation automation (5.2.102)
	the build structure is located in the SVN : https://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/divastudio/trunk/divastudio
		the "plugins" folder must have svn:externals that points to all the plugins that
		need to be compiled
		the "features" folder must have svn:externals that points to all the features that
		need to be compiled
		the features/eu.ict_diva.studio.main.feature/feature.xml must reference all the features that
		need to be compiled	
5.2.102 Automation of the compilation
	Automates the build of the divastudio sources in a deployable format (format being used by Task 5.2.103)	
	We suppose that we have a local check out of the build structure (that includes  of all the sources) from https://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/divastudio/trunk/divastudio
	The task must get and unzip a base from the web. Then, it must build the sources against this base.
	It will export the resulting build as a set of jar ready to deploy (as an update site)
	and finally publish it for the partners on the web  (http://divastudio.gforge.inria.fr/bundle/latest_build/updatesite)
	
	This script/program must be deployable on the infrastructure (Task 5.2.105) and also runnable/testable locally. By runnable locally, 
	we means, that if we checkout the build structure locally, one can launch the compilation with one command on the command line 
	regardless of the physical location on the disk.
	
5.2.103 Automation of the build of the DiVA bundle 
	Automates the build of a full eclipse bundle from the latest DivaStudio base and the latest compiled
	This must also ensure that all actions from the manual procedure are handled, including a clean installation and the branding)
  	The result must be published for the partners on http://divastudio.gforge.inria.fr/bundle/latest_build
	This script/program must be deployable on the infrastructure (Task 5.2.105) and also testable locally 

5.2.104 Automation of storage and cleanup of the bundles on the web server
	This task is responsible for providing a way of maintaining a reasonable amount of build archives regarding disk usage. 
	It is able to store archive from the latest build and remove old archives when some criterion are reached.
	For example, we can keep one archive per month on the last 5 months.
	This script/program must be deployable on the infrastructure (Task 5.2.105) and also testable locally
	
5.2.105 Continuous build infrastructure [INRIA]
	This task provides the physical infrastructure to run all the automation scripts
	Installation of a machine (physical or virtual) with an OS suitable for running the automation tasks.
	Installation of the required compilation/build tools.
	Configuration of the machine to launch the automation tasks on a regular basis (for example every day or every week for )
	Configuration of the machine for notifying the partners in case of trouble when the scripts notify a failure.
	This can typically be done using an hudson server.
