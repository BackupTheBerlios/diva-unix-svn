	install arborcraft	
- copy the plugin (from project thirdparty_plugins) 
	ca.uwaterloo.gp.fmp*.jar to the dropin folder of this eclipse
	(later we should repackage that from the sources on sourceforge ?)

- generate the site and all plugins (in eu.ict_diva.studio.site/site.xml > build all)


DiVAStudio (final)
--------------------------
This is the studio delivered to the users

	install arborcraft
- from the local update in DiVAStudio_dev
	retrieve all features
- copy the plugin (in project thirdparty_plugins) 
	ca.uwaterloo.gp.fmp*.jar to the dropin folder of this eclipse
- to install SmartAdapterts:
  - put fr.irisa.triskell.kermeta.flora2_1.0.0.jar into dropins
  - put the third parties (flora2 + XSB) a PatternMatching folder, inside the eclipse folder (with eclipse.exe)
