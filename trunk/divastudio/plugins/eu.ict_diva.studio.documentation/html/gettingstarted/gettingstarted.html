<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<p>
The DiVA studio comes with several documentations and tutorials in order to help you discover its features.
</p>
<p>
The main document that drives all other documents is the methodology document. It describes the steps for dealing with 
dynamic adaptive system. The user should refer to it as much as possible. Then, when working with a 
given component, he will be able to read the documentation dedicated to it. 
</p>
<p>
The various steps (and underlying components) are illustrated using samples available in the studio. 
Most of them are the support of <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/divawebsite/tutorials">tutorial videos</a>.
