Several fire or attack or energy strategies are supported by the system: - Fire strategy: if a fire is detected at the airport all the smoke detectors of the airport are activated(used in case of fire) - Attack strategy if a suspicious behavior is detected all the video cameras of the airport are activated - EnergySaving strategy: this variant activates an only one sensor  of a given type in each zone of the airport (used by default). 

The crisis Management System is able to connect to several external organizations according to the context: - When there are human victims the system connects to a hospital - When there is fire, crisis explosion or physical damages the system connects to a fire department - In case of attack or a suspect behavior the system connects to a police station - When an escalation is needed the system connects to the defense minestry - When it is required to inform population about the crisis the system connects to external media systems (for example a TV channel). 

The thinking tool is based on several fire or terrorism or medic or tactic or information decision making components that are used mainly according to the crisis type: - The fire planning component is able to determine the organisations and the actors that must be involved, the resources to deploy and the tasks to perform in case of fire - The medical planner component is used when there are victims in order to determine the organisations and the actors that must be involved, the resources to deploy and the tasks to carry out - The terrorism planner is able to determine the organisations and the actors that must be involved, the resources to deploy and the tasks to carry out in case of attack - The tactical planner is used in case of crisis in order to estimates, assumptions, analyses, and judgments about the situation to create cohesive situation awareness and plan the communication with external organisations - The information Planner is used when it needed to inform media about a crisis

Traceability of events is very important in crisis management, the logging level changes according to the alert level. The following levels must be supported: Normal log or Critical log or Warning or Push or Push broadcast.
